<h2>Creating distraction-free reading experiences</h2>
<p>When I read Kenya Hara’s book, “white” (白) a few months ago, I couldn’t help but notice how quickly I became immersed in it. Whether it was in a train full of grumpy commuters or at at a coffee shop packed with over-caffeinated people, I was able to instantly fade out all the noise around me. It felt like a revelation because the book was designed in a way that was completely contrary to the noisy and distracting reality of todays web.</p>

<p>Distractions have always been a natural constituent of our lives. But with the rise of mobile technology, a circus of notifications, and all the noise going on around us, it’s become harder and harder to focus on a task at hand.</p>

<p>On the web, we are confronted with an unprecedented amount of distractions that gave birth to various tools like Readability, Instapaper, Adblocker, etc. Attention span shortens while the quality of reading experiences declines; ultimately leaving a lot of great content out there undiscovered, unloved, unshared and unread by most.</p>

<p><strong>This is not how we imagined the web to be.</strong>

<p>It’s our job as designers to bring clarity back to the digital canvas by crafting reading experiences that put readers first.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://">How can we create distraction-free reading experiences?
</blockquote>

<p>Creating distraction-free reading experiences, first of all, means getting rid of on-screen distractions. So what are on-screen distractions?</p>

<h3>The Bird Paradox</h3>

<p>A good way to explain the concept of on-screen distractions is what I call the bird-paradox. You’ve probably played flappy bird by now and are wondering, “What does this have to do with distraction-free experiences?”. Quite a lot as it turns out.</p>

<p>This whole game is all about focus. The slightest distraction results in an immediate death, pain and frustration. There are a ridiculous amount of articles out there sharing tips on how to improve. It wasn’t until a friend told me to stop glancing at the score, that I was able to take my game to the next level. If you think about it, all he was really saying was “focus on the essence of the game”.</p>

<p>Obviously, designing reading experiences is not the same as designing a game but it brings up a worthwhile question:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://"> Why do designers impede their readers with such a huge amount of bullshit?</blockquote>

<p>Let’s see how we can spare readers from this misery by designing reading experiences that put readers first.</p>

<h2>On type & content</h2>

<p>Typography and content obviously build the fundamental building block of everything that is meant to be read.</p>

<p>In fact, so much has been said about it already, we could probably fill libraries based on the topic of crafting and setting beautiful and readable type. That’s not the point of this article. It’s important to be aware that typography has the most profound impact in the perception and interpretation of our work though.</p>

<p>Read <a href="#">Matthew Butterick’s practical typography guide</a>.

<p>You will find a few rules that, when applied, significantly improve reading experiences. Bad typography doesn’t just look bad, it’s highly distracting, makes peoples thoughts wander, is tiresome and ineffective.</p>

<p>Do yourself and your readers a favor: Find out how type works.</p>
