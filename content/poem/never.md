Never deny the power of withdrawal.

Never doubt that thought and time make things small.

Never refuse the easy exit line or prescribed
uncomprehending gesture. At childhood’s end,
none can tell happiness from buoyancy.

None of it made any difference—
the patricides, the hotels ill-constructed,
the inconstant starlight of drugs and rebellion.

We are no more complicated
than our great-grandparents who dreaded
the hotel life. Like them, we seek the refuge
of warm days in January, a piety
whose compulsion is to survive according
to explicit laws no young woman adores
or young man follows with darling hunger.
