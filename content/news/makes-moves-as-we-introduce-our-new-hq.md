We packed our things last October and moved to Makers Quarter in the heart of downtown San Diego. Despite being a mere five-minute drive from our old headquarters, our new neighborhood could not be more distinct. Home to some of San Diego’s most ambitious businesses, organizations, artists, and entrepreneurs, we’ve situated ourselves right in the thick of the city’s cultural hotbed.

>We’re always reinventing our business to try and stay ahead of culture and technology, and when it comes to the city of San Diego, we feel there’s no better place to do that than here in Makers Quarter.

“The world is changing around us, and as a company, we’ve really needed to evolve to thrive in this shifting landscape,” said Matt Faulk, BASIC’s founder and CEO. “We’re always reinventing our business to try and stay ahead of culture and technology, and when it comes to the city of San Diego, we feel there’s no better place to do that than here in Makers Quarter.”

Known as Block D, our building boasts zero-energy capability and a completely modern industrial design—reflecting our team’s penchant for innovation and simplicity.

Our team collaborated with San Diego’s top architects and designers from BNIM and Brewer Design to bring our state-of-the-art space to life. Every room, furnishing, and accent was curated with purpose and an eye for detail.

The new office is as functional as it is beautiful, and our emphasis on simplicity is reflected in our space’s design. Scenic views, multiple garage doors, passive ventilation, natural light, and reflective concrete put health and harmony at the core of the design. We also installed modular spaces that can be easily changed to suit the team’s needs as the business grows.

We’ve established an atmosphere to help keep our team focused and inspired. We designated specific zones for collaboration, isolation, unexpected encounters and communal activities, all in an effort to help minimize distractions, maximize creativity, and encourage people to do great work.
