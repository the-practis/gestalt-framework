This past weekend, BASIC® collaborated on a pro-bono creative sprint with Good Measure, a cause-based creative organization. Within a 72-hour window, the team helped produce and deliver a brand identity, positioning, and strategy, as well as an introductory video and full digital design and development for Humble Design, a Detroit-based nonprofit that helps families transition out of homelessness.

The agency's San Diego office hosted over 100 do-gooders, including strategists, illustrators, designers, developers, and videographers—all from different agencies and organizations from across the country, united by the promise of social change. The ask was a complete brand overhaul at each touchpoint, and for two days and three nights, the Good Measure participants worked tirelessly to enrich the brand and sustain its longevity by helping secure funds from donors and charities.

Once the 72 hours came to an end, the results spoke for themselves. The team was invigorated, the client was ecstatic, and another family was one step closer to starting anew and leaving behind homelessness for good.

"This is what we do every day. This is our job," said BASIC® designer Lizzie Callen. "But for the client, this meant so much to them that people would dedicate their time and effort to this cause."
