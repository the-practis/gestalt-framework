Walt Mossberg:

>People focus on the fact that iPad unit sales peaked a few years ago. But they forget that:
>* iPad sales took off faster than iPhone sales.
>* Itâ€™s likely that over 300 million iPads have been sold.
>* By annual revenue, if the iPad were a company, it would be on the Fortune 500.

I think the big factor with iPad sales peaking so early is two-fold. First, they soared early because the iPad filled a heretofore unfilled space. Post-iPhone, people got what the iPad was immediately and they wanted one. Sales then declined ([but have leveled off in recent years](https://www.statista.com/statistics/299632/tablet-shipments-apple/)), I think, because iPads last so long, and a years-old iPad still does all the things most people want from an iPad very well.
