Adamya Sharma reporting for Android Authority:

> Another cheaper iPhone might help Apple bolster iPhone sales in 2020 and further grow its market presence. It’ll also better equip the company to compete with [upcoming Android rivals](https://www.androidauthority.com/upcoming-android-phone-690821/), especially in price conscious markets like India.

India's a hot spot for mobile phone right now, so it'll be a good look for Apple's future to try and get in the game for some marketshare.
