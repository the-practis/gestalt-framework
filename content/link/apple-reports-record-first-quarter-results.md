The Company posted quarterly revenue of $91.8 billion, an increase of 9 percent from the year-ago quarter and an all-time record, and quarterly earnings per diluted share of $4.99, up 19 percent, also an all-time record. International sales accounted for 61 percent of the quarterâ€™s revenue.

Looking at the details for year-over-year net sales:

* iPhone: +7.7%
* Mac: -3.5%
